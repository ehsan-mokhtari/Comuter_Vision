```diff
+ Face Detector Real Time
```
In this project, using opencv and cascades, we detect the face realtime with camera and then draw circle over the face.</br>
Remember to copy your own cascade address in opencv main folder then paste in "cascade_locaion" variable.</br> 
For example my cascade location is in "C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Lib\site-packages\cv2\data"</br>
As you can see the results, the face is detected and drawed purple circle over it!</br></br>
